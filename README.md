# HOMIE
2017 Project - Security System

HOMIE is a smart home security system that makes sure your home is secure while you're gone. The intelligence comes from the interaction the home owner and the security system will have. When the motion sensor at the front door is triggered, HOMIE will ask the home owner for identification, a password, and even ask whether the home owner is leaving or returning home.
